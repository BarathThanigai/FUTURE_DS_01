## Objectives

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Clean and validate raw retail data for analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understand data structure, distributions, and relationships
- **Revenue Analysis**: Identify top products and countries by revenue
- **Sales Trends**: Analyze monthly revenue patterns over time
- **Demand Forecasting**: Predict future revenue using time-series forecasting (Prophet)
- **Visualization**: Create insightful charts and visualizations for stakeholder communication

## Dataset Description

The project analyzes online retail transaction data with the following key columns:

- **InvoiceNo**: Unique transaction identifier
- **StockCode**: Product code
- **Description**: Product name/description
- **Quantity**: Number of units sold (negative values indicate returns)
- **InvoiceDate**: Date of transaction
- **UnitPrice**: Price per unit
- **CustomerID**: Unique customer identifier
- **Country**: Customer's country

### Data Files

- `online_retail.csv`: Main dataset with transaction records
- `data.csv`: Alternative dataset format
- `Sample - Superstore.csv`: Sample superstore data

## Installation & Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- **Optional**: Microsoft Power BI Desktop (to view and edit the .pbix file)

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn prophet
```

Or use the notebook's built-in installation:

```python
!pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
!pip install prophet
```

## Usage

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open `Online_Retail_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`
5. Execute cells sequentially to run the analysis

### Running the Python Script

```bash
python OnlineRetail.py
```

### Viewing Power BI Dashboard

**Option 1: Interactive Dashboard (.pbix)**
- Open `Online_Retail_Sales_Analysis.pbix` with Microsoft Power BI Desktop
- Explore interactive visualizations and drill-down capabilities
- Filter data by country, product, date range, and more
- Use bookmarks for quick navigation between views

**Option 2: PDF Report**
- Open `Online_Retail_Sales_Analysis.pdf` for a static report export
- Perfect for sharing with stakeholders without Power BI access
- Contains all key visualizations and insights

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Load data from CSV
   - Display basic statistics and info
   - Check for missing and duplicate values

### 2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
   - Handle missing CustomerIDs
   - Remove invalid unit prices (≤ 0)
   - Create TransactionType column (Sales vs Returns)
   - Calculate Revenue (Quantity × UnitPrice)

### 3. **Revenue Analysis**
   - **Top Products**: Identify top 10 products by total revenue
   - **Geographic Analysis**: Analyze revenue by country
   - **Transaction Types**: Differentiate between sales and returns

### 4. **Sales Trends**
   - **Monthly Trends**: Analyze revenue patterns month-over-month
   - **Visualization**: Line plots showing revenue progression

### 5. **Forecasting**
   - **Prophet Model**: Time-series forecasting for next 180 days
   - **Future Predictions**: Predict future revenue trends
   - **Visualization**: Plot historical data with forecast

## Key Outputs

### Jupyter Notebook & Python Script Outputs

### Visualizations Generated

- **Monthly Revenue Trend Chart**: Line plot showing revenue over time
- **Top Products Bar Chart**: Top 10 products by revenue
- **Geographic Revenue Chart**: Top 10 countries by revenue
- **Revenue Forecast Chart**: 180-day revenue forecast with confidence intervals
